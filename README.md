# msmq4j
Microsoft Message Queue for Java - started the project while attempting to get MSMQ working for integration into a clients application. 

## msmq4j-com4j
Most of the development and testing is done under the msmq4j-com4j project.  I found that com4j was easier to implement while performing the configuration and testing.  There were a lot less requirements and "gotchas" that I found.  The project doesn't have much in it, as once I got things working I continued the functionality within the clients project.

## msmq4j-interop
This was working for a bit, but ran into issues.

## msmq4j-samples
No actual samples - check each project tests for functional testing.
